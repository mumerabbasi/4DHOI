} 

- Rules for analysis: 
  (1) There are two types of nodes in the output interaction graph: "object part nodes" representing object parts and "body part nodes" representing human body parts. 
  (2) The "object part nodes" field represent a part-level segmentation of each input object. Segmentations should roughly cover the entire object without becoming excessively detailed. Use descriptive, specific part names rather than generic terms, for example, avoid "surface", "edge", "body", "base", "area", "cover", "support", "connector", "frame", and the like. Do not differentiate between left and right parts. Avoid numbering object parts. Example: For a "bike", use the following parts: "handlebar", "pedal", "seat", "frame tubes", "wheels". For a "skateboard", use the following parts: "longboard deck", "wheels". For a "cordless vacuum cleaner", use the following parts: "ergonomic hand grip", "wand", "floor roller". For a "ladder", use the following parts: "side rail tubes", "rungs". For a "boxing bag", use the following parts: "punching bag". 
  (3) The "body part nodes" field must be the following: "left hand", "right hand", "left arm", "right arm", "left shoulder", "right shoulder", "left leg", "right leg", "left foot", "right foot", "head", "hips". Distinguish between left/right human body parts. 
  (4) The "interaction edges" represent direct physical contact relationships between two end nodes. An edge connects an object part node to either a human body part node or another object part node. Do not connect part nodes within the same object. Example: when ironing on an ironing board, the soleplate part of an iron should be connected to the top flat panel part of the ironing board. Each edge has two attributes: "is_continuous" and "is_rel_static". The "is_continuous" attribute is true if the two end nodes are in continuous physical contact during the interaction process, otherwise false. Example: when holding a dumbbell, the hand is in continuous contact with the handle without any separation; when punching a boxing bag, the hands are not in continuous contact with the bag; when a person stepping up a ladder, the feet and hands are both not in continuous contact with the rungs. The "is_rel_static" attribute is true if the two end nodes' movements are relatively stationary to each other while being in continuous physical contact during the interaction process, otherwise false. Example: when riding a bike, hands are relatively stationary to the handlebar; when playing a guitar, the hand strumming strings is not relatively stationary to the main compartment of the guitar. 
  (5) Explicitly mentioned body parts in the input "interaction" field must be included. Example: For a description "a person is lifting a single dumbbell with one hand", include either "left hand" or "right hand" in the analysis. If no specific body part is mentioned, use the most common ergonomic interactions in the physical contact analysis. 
  (6) Focus on primary actions influencing object use or movement in the physical contact analysis. Example: For "a person walking and carrying a briefcase in one hand", the primary action for analysis is "carrying". 
  (7) Ensure the identified object parts belong to their respective objects in the node and edge outputs of the interaction graph. 
  (8) Ensure plausible distribution and avoid conflicts or duplication of human body parts during the interaction analysis. 
  (9) Exclude environmental elements, like floor, ground, or wall, from the physical contact analysis. 
  (10) The "interaction" field in the output JSON must concisely summarize the "interaction edges" of the graph to guide realistic video generation. Follow this structure: 
	(a) Begin with the interaction(s) as described in the input short "interaction" description. Clearly specify each participant's role if multiple people or objects are involved. All motions must occur at an extremely slow pace. 
	(b) Then describe the interaction motion details, focusing on physical contact between human body parts and object parts. If a human is specified to be non-static, make sure their body parts without physical contact show expressive movement. For example, when "skateboarding", the person's arms can swing to maintain balance, and the legs can bend slightly; when "cleaning with a cordless vacuum cleaner", the arm that is not holding the vacuum can swing naturally while walking; when "riding a scooter", one foot can remain static on the deck while the other swings to push off the ground and gain speed. Importantly, the human body parts without physical contact must also move in slow motion. 
	(c) Next, describe the appearance of people, objects, and environments. For people, you must strictly include the following four aspects: their hair styles, facial expressions, clothes, and shoes. For example, "short black hair", "neutral facial expression", "wearing a gray shirt, blue jeans, and white sneakers". For objects, describe general type and appearance without overly specific details. The environment is always a clean, spacious indoor area with white walls and a wooden floor. Ensure the environment supports the action without adding unnecessary complexity. 
	(d) The "interaction" summarization must not exceed 150 words. 
  (11) The "object states" in the output JSON have four attributes, "name", "is_translational", "is_rotational", and "description", for each object. The "is_translational" attribute is true if the corresponding object has global translational motions during interaction, otherwise false. The "is_rotational" attribute is true if the corresponding object has global rotational motions during interaction, otherwise false. Both "is_translational" and "is_rotational" attributes must consider only the object's overall motion, not motions of individual parts, for example, a bike being ridden should be considered as moving translationally as a whole, while ignoring the rotation of its pedals. The object "description" attribute should clearly identify the object by briefly stating its type, appearance, and its interactions with human bodies, using no more than 20 words. The object "description" should be based on relevant "interaction edges" and the long "interaction" fields in the output. In the object "description", avoid using numerical or ordinal references. 
  (12) The "human states" in the output JSON have two attributes, "name" and "description", for each person. The human "description" attribute should clearly identify the person by briefly stating their appearance and interactions with object parts in 20 words. The human "description" should be based on relevant "interaction edges" and the long "interaction" fields in the output. Avoid using numerical or ordinal references in the "description" attribute.

- Task: You will receive one image file that actually contains two separate images shown side-by-side (left and right), along with a short text describing human-object interactions. Look closely at both images and read the text description. Use the "Analysis Rules" below to decide which single image ("left" or "right") is a better match for both the rules and the text description. 
- Input format: 
	(1) One image file that includes two images placed next to each other horizontally, like this: [left image | right image]. 
	(2) One short text that describes the human-object interactions that should be happening in the images. 
- Output format: You must output only one word: either "left" or "right". Do not add any other words, explanations, or comments. 
- Analysis Rules: 
	(1) Full Human Figures: Prefer the image where people are shown completely, from their heads down to their feet, inside the image area, and where the front faces of the main people involved in the interaction are clearly visible. 
	(2) Correct Anatomy: Prefer the image where humans have normal-looking body parts and proportions. Avoid images showing people with distorted, disfigured, or anatomically incorrect limbs or bodies. 
	(3) Matching Text Description: Prefer the image where the human-object interactions match the provided short text description. 
	(4) Plausible Interactions: Prefer the image where interactions between people and objects look natural, physically plausible. Avoid interactions that involve problematic body parts, like strangely bent or extra limbs. Avoid images with unrealistic physics, like people or objects floating in the air. 
	(5) Camera View: Prefer wide-shot images taken from a shoulder-height, three-quarter side view that clearly shows both the pose and the interaction. If that's not available, prefer side views over straight-on front views. Avoid images taken from high-up, low-down, or close-up views that crop or obscure full human figures. Also avoid images where people or objects are too close to walls or background objects. 
	(6) Sharp Details: Prefer images with clear, sharp details, and avoid images with motion blur around human body parts. 
	(7) Realistic Style: Prefer photographic or realistic images over cartoons, drawings, illustrations, or images with very artistic styles. 
	(8) Do not consider the mood, feeling, or atmosphere of the image in your comparison.

- Task: You will be given the following information: 
  (1) a short human-object interaction description. 
  (2) a list of 3D joint positions for one or more humans. 
  (3) a specified 3D object involved in the interaction. The object has a 3D bounding box, a list of segmented parts, and optionally, bounding boxes for each part. 
  (4) a list of physical contact pairs between an object part and a human body part. 
  Your task is to generate four rotation transformation candidates for the specified 3D object. Each transformation should make the object's placement physically plausible, based on the human poses and the described interaction. 

- Input format: The input is provided in the JSON format as follows 
{
	"interaction": "a short interaction description",
	"joints": [
		{
			"name": "person 1, human body part 1",
			"position": [x1, y1, z1]
		},
		{
			"name": "person 1, human body part 2",
			"position": [x2, y2, z2]
		}
	],

		"name": "object 1",
		"bounding_box": [x_min, y_min, z_min, x_max, y_max, z_max],
		"parts": [
			{
				"name": "object part a",
				"bounding_box": [x_min, y_min, z_min, x_max, y_max, z_max]
			},
			{
				"name": "object part b"
			}
		]
	},
	"contact": [
		"object 1, object part a, person 1, human body part b"
	]
}

- Output format: Provide the output strictly in JSON format, without any additional explanation or commentary: 
{
	"rotations": [
		{"y_angle": theta_1},
		{"y_angle": theta_2},
		{"y_angle": theta_3},
		{"y_angle": theta_4}
	]
}

- Rules for analysis: 
  (1) The up direction is along the positive y-axis, and the gravity direction is along the negative y-axis. 
  (2) Multiple people can be involved in the interaction. People are labeled as "person 1", "person 2", etc. 
  (3) Human "joints" are specified by combining a person ID with their body part names, along with precise 3D coordinates. These positions are fixed and should not be transformed during the analysis. 
  (4) Estimate person orientation using key joints such as the neck and shoulders. 
  (5) The specified 3D object is placed near the origin of the world coordinate system, with its up direction along the positive y-axis and its front direction along the positive z-axis. 
  (6) The object's bounding box is axis-aligned and defined by its minimum and maximum x, y, and z coordinates. 
  (7) The object has a list of segmented "parts", roughly covering the entire object. Example: a "bike" has the following part names: "handlebar", "pedal", "seat", "frame tubes", "wheels". An object part can have a bounding box defined by its minimum and maximum x, y, and z coordinates. This part bounding box information is optional in the input, can be imprecise, and should only be used to get rough part locations or object orientations. 
  (8) Each "contact" entry includes four parts: object name, object part name, person name, and human body part name. For example, "bicycle, handlebar, person 1, left hand" means the left hand of person 1 is in contact with the bicycle's handlebar. 
  (9) You must return four rotation transformation candidates for the specified 3D object. The transformations must be different and cover diverse object placements relative to the humans. Each transformation is defined by a rotation angle in degrees around the y-axis (the "y_angle" field in the output json). Concretely, suppose a transformation candidate is defined as follows: "y_angle" is theta degrees. The coordinates of a 3D point [x, y, z] are transformed as follows: [x * cos(theta * pi / 180) + z * sin(theta * pi / 180), y, -x * sin(theta * pi / 180) + z * cos(theta * pi / 180)]. 
  (10) For each transformation, you must apply the transformation to the object and its part bounding boxes, then validate whether the transformed object and its parts respect the contact constraints with the specified human joint positions. 
  (11) To generate valid object transformations, consider all available input information: the interaction description, joint positions, human orientations, object bounding box, object part bounding boxes, and the part-level contact information.
